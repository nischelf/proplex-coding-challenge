## How it works

User should be able to:

- `Add` a new todo
- `Mark` a todo as completed
- `Delete` a todo
- `Edit` a todo

### Data Persistence

- Todos are stored in the `localStorage` of the browser. _!Every browser has his own localStorage!_

# Possible Extensions

- Add a `search` feature to search for todos.
- Add a `filter` feature to filter todos based on their status.
- Add a `sort` feature to sort todos based on their priority.
- Add a `Data Persistence` feature to save todos in the database.
